# My Portfolio

## About

My portfolio contains a brief introduction to who I am and what I've done, do, and plan to accomplish.

## The Process

Since I've been hooked on Angular.js and ui.router, I used them for the functionality of my page. I have different sections that are essentially states between which the user can toggle. The logic that is used is mainly handled within services and factories, such as my stored projects and quotes that I use.

I intentionally did not add Bootstrap to this app in order to show both my CSS abilities outside of that library and that I'm not dependent on it, though it is, of course, a very useful library.

## The Code

The following is an explanation of my directory structure:

* 'node_modules': mainly the backend dependencies

* 'site':  the site itself and all of its frontend resources
  * 'components': reusable services/factories as well as routing and other configs

  * 'css': the css the index references, although I'm using SASS which is found in the 'scss' directory

  * 'favicons', 'images', 'images-min': resources used in the site, 'images-min' being the minified versions of the images.

  * 'partials': using ui.router, I create a subdirectory for each state/view containing its template url and controller if it has one.
