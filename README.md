# My Portfolio

## About

My portfolio contains a brief introduction to who I am and what I've done, do, and plan to accomplish.

## The Process

Since I've been hooked on Angular.js and ui.router, I used them for the functionality of my page. I have different sections that are essentially states between which the user can toggle. The logic that is used is mainly handled within services and factories, such as my stored projects and quotes that I use.

I intentionally did not add Bootstrap to this app in order to show both my CSS abilities outside of that library and that I'm not dependent on it, though it is, of course, a very useful library.
