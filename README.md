# My Portfolio

## About

My portfolio contains a brief introduction to who I am and what I've done, do, and plan to accomplish.

## The Process

For the first iteration of my portfolio, I had used AngularJS along with ui.router to make it seem essentially like a single-page web app, allowing the user to toggle through different states, such as a home, about me, and projects section.

For this iteration, I've decided to use jQuery as, in my opinion, it is much more useful for achieving a certain design and feeling, assuming not much advanced functionality will be involved (which, in this case, is true). Not only jQuery's library, but also its third party plugins, contribute to this usefulness. As of now, I will be using HandlebarsJS to take care of the functionality Angular originally handled.

I intentionally did not add Bootstrap to this app in order to show both my CSS abilities outside of that library and that I'm not dependent on it, though it is, of course, a very useful library.

## The Code

The following is an explanation of my directory structure:

* 'node_modules': mainly the backend dependencies

* 'css': the css the index references, although I'm using SASS which is found in the 'scss' directory

* 'favicons', 'images', 'images-min': resources used in the site, 'images-min' being the minified versions of the images.
