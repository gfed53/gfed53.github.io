			<p class="about-content-maintext">I am a web developer based near New York City, and am looking to learn from and contribute to a professional dev team. I recently graduated from <a class="text-link" href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful's</a> intensive Web Development Career Path, where I was mentored by seasoned professional developers, and learned to work with HTML, CSS and Sass, JavaScript, jQuery, version control via Git and GitHub, mobile-first responsive development, and advanced build tools. I spent the majority of the course working extensively with AngularJS, but I even got into some canvas game development.</p>

		<div class="about-content">
			<p class="about-content-maintext">Some of my hobbies include playing guitar, listening to obscure music, gaming, and exercising. With programming, I see it as more than just a means to an end. The obstacles that I overcome through code give me a sense of power and pride that is unique to this area of work. I'd like to share that feeling with the rest of the world someday.</p>
