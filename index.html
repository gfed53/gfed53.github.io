      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an aspiring web developer, relatively new to the wonderful world of coding and programming in general. I've always had an interest in technology of all avenues, and since around October of 2014 have started to learn various languages on my own.</p>
      <p>I've been working as a focus group recruiter for over 4 years now <span class="meek">(yikes...)</span>, trying to use it as a stepping stone to getting into the area of market research. I didn't think it was possible to remain on a stepping stone for so long without falling into the water. Luckily, I was able to grab ahold of the helicopter rope ladder that is web development. We shall see where that takes me..</p>
      <p>Put generally, I'm just a lover of all things interesting in life. If it's different and it stands out, I'm sure I can find some beauty in it, or at the very least find something to ponder over.</p>
      <p>What's important to me is to be successful in whatever I do, while still maintaining a balance of life, eventually reaching the point where I can enjoy work as if it were a hobby.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from West Nyack, New York. I guess a good reference point would be that I'm about 2 minutes away from the Palisades Mall. Yeah, ever heard of that monstrosity?
    </p>
      <p>
    I graduated from the University at Albany back in 2010 with a degree in Business Administration and a concentration in Marketing Management.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p>One of my biggest passions in life is music as I am a musician, playing guitar and also some bass. My second love would have to be gaming, particularly PC and retro gaming. I also enjoy working out, but it's mainly more to keep in shape rather than looking at my muscles in the mirror...honestly!</p>
      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>As of now I am an aspiring web developer, but I also fantasize about becoming a video game dev one day. However, I don't think the world is ready for Flappy Bird 2.0.</p>
      <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
      <p>Ah, don't get me started. I love progressive rock, metal, <span class="strng">progressive metal</span> (naturally), and any guitar-driven genre of music, but still find time to listen to Top 40 (the metal community would crucify me for this).</p>
