		<h1>Who I Am</h1>
		<p>I was born and raised in West Nyack, New York, and have lived here pretty much my whole life. I graduated with a Bachelors Degree of Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing Management from the University at Albany in 2010.</p>
		<p>Some of my hobbies include playing guitar, listening to obscure music and trying to find people who actually have heard of it, (mostly retro) gaming, being somewhat of a YouTube junkie (shamelessly), and exercising religiously.</p>
		<p>Put generally, I'm just a lover of all things interesting in life. If it's different and it stands out, I'm sure I can find some beauty in it, or at the very least find something to ponder over.</p>
		<p>What's important to me is to be successful in whatever I do, while still maintaining a balance of life, eventually reaching the point where I can enjoy work as if it were a hobby.</p>

		<h1>What I Do</h1>
		<p>I am a junior-level front end web developer look to gain experience in the field. I've always had an interest in technology of all avenues, and since around October of 2014 have started to learn various languages on my own.
		</p><p>I then studied front end web development through <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful's</a> Front End Career Path. I went from learning the fundamental building blocks of HTML/CSS, version control of GIT, core concepts of Javascript, to responsive design/mobile-first web development, CSS preprocessors, some game development, and eventually tackling the extensive framework of Angular, all the while learning to use various libraries to make life as a web developer easier and more enjoyable.</p>
