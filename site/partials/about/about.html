			<p class="about-content-maintext">I am a front end web developer looking to gain experience in the field. I have been studying front end web development through <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful's</a> Front End Career Path. I have worked with the fundamental building blocks of HTML/CSS, version control of GIT, and core concepts of Javascript, to responsive design/mobile-first web development, CSS preprocessors, some game development, and eventually tackling the extensive framework of Angular, all the while learning to use various libraries to make life as a web developer easier and more enjoyable.</p>

		<div class="about-content">
			<p class="about-content-maintext">Some of my hobbies include playing guitar, listening to obscure music, gaming, and exercising. With coding, I see it as more than just a means to an end. The obsticles that I overcome through code give me a sense of power and pride that is unique to this area of work. I'd like to share that feeling with the rest of the world someday.</p>
